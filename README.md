## Description
Links Finder is a tool for quickly finding and opening links in a file. The program uses a regular expression pattern to find links in the file and displays them in an array. The user can then choose which links they want to open in their web browser. The file path can be indicated with the `-f` flag or the program will prompt the user for it.

## Installation
Links Finder requires Python 3 to run.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_NAME]/Links-Finder.git
```
## Usage
Run the program:
```
python links-finder.py -f /path/to/file
```
Alternatively, if you do not specify a file path with the `-f` flag, the program will prompt you for it:
```
python links-finder.py
Enter the file path: /path/to/file
```
